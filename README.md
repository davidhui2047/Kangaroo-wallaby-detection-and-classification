# Kangaroo-wallaby-detection-and-classification
A machine leanring model with 96% accuarcy for Kangaroo-wallaby detection and classification is developed using transfer leanring in this project. 

The model is developed using a pre-trained model in Faster-RCNN.

Pre-trained model in YOLOv5 and RetinaNet are also used for model development.

In order to create a dataset. 1500 images for Kangaroos and Wallabies is collected from Google search using Python. Images are labelled using LabelImg.

Tensorflow, PyTorch and Detectron2 are used for model development.

The following video show the preformace of the model:
